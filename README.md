# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
### Problem statement
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Steps
Steps:
* Defining the path for train and test images
* Load using keras.preprocessing
* Create a dataset
* Data cleaning
* Visualize the data
* create a code to visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset.
* Create the model.
* Compile the model.
* Train the model
* Visualizing training results
* Write your findings after the model fit, see if there is an evidence of model overfit or underfit
* Write your findings here
* Create the model, compile and train the model
* Compiling the model
* Training the model
* Visualizing the results
* Summary
* Which class has the least number of samples?
* Which classes dominate the data in terms proportionate number of samples?
* Lets see the distribution of augmented data after adding new images to the original training data.
* Train the model on the data created using Augmentor
* Create a training dataset
* Create a validation dataset
* Create your model (make sure to include normalization)
* Compile your model (Choose optimizer and loss function appropriately)
* Train your model
* Visualize the model results
* Analyze your results here. Did you get rid of underfitting/overfitting? Did class rebalance help?
* Predit on new data
